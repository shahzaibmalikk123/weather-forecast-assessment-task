# Weather Forecast App - Your Dynamic Weather Companion

Welcome , a feature-rich weather application built using React Native and Expo. This application offers a seamless and visually engaging experience, providing users with real-time weather information, dynamic UI elements, and detailed forecasts. Whether you're planning your day or staying prepared for the week ahead, this Weather App has you covered.

## Key Features

### Location-Based Weather

Upon launching Weatherly, users are prompted to grant location access. When permission is granted, the app retrieves and displays precise weather data based on the user's current location. In the event that location access is denied, the app gracefully defaults to a predefined location's weather information.

### Search Functionality

Weather Application empowers users to explore weather data from around the world. Utilizing the integrated search bar, users can enter any location of their choice to instantly access the relevant weather details. The app then presents a comprehensive snapshot of the weather, complete with temperature, city name, weather type, and more.

### Dynamic User Interface

Experience weather like never before with Weather Application's dynamic user interface. As the weather conditions change, so does the app's appearance. Background images, animations, and icons seamlessly adapt to the current weather, creating an immersive and engaging visual experience.

### 7-Day Weather Outlook

Stay informed and prepared with Weather Application's comprehensive 7-day weather outlook. Users can quickly access a week's worth of weather predictions, allowing for effective planning and decision-making.

### 8-Unit Testing

Weatherly incorporates unit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of its components. The tests are written using a combination of testing libraries and tools to provide comprehensive coverage and robust validation. I have done unit testing for DaywiseForecastView.js, DesiredForecastView.js and WeeklyForecastView.js.
